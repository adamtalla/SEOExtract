You are now improving an AI-powered SEO SaaS app called **SEOExtract**. It generates top keywords and SEO suggestions when a user enters a website URL. The tool is already functional but needs to be turned into a proper SaaS product with working pricing tiers, a landing page, and account management.

🔧 Here’s what I need you to do:

---

🚨 1. **Fix Bugs**
- The **Free trial logic is broken** — currently users can’t run even 1 audit. Fix this so the plan limits actually work.
- Ensure keyword generation and suggestion features work per the limits.
- Make sure audits run smoothly without throwing errors on repeat usage.

---

🌐 2. **Rename the app**
- Change all branding and page titles to **SEOExtract**

---

🎨 3. **Add a SaaS landing page**
- Add these public-facing pages:
  - `Home`
  - `Plans`
  - `About`
  - `FAQ`
  - `Login` / `Signup`
- Use a modern design (TailwindCSS or similar is fine)
- Navbar should be sticky and link to all pages
- Add a CTA button: “Try SEOExtract Free”

---

🔐 4. **User Authentication with Supabase**
- Add full auth system using **Supabase**
- Allow signup, login, and logout
- Store audit and usage history per user
- Plan data and usage limits should be saved in Supabase and enforced

---

💳 5. **Stripe Integration for Pricing Plans**
Set up 3 plans with the following features, and enforce limits per plan:

---

### 🟢 Free — $0/month
- 3 audits per month
- 5 keywords per audit

---

📦 6. **Enforce Plan Features in the App**
- Limit audits per month per plan correctly
- Limit keywords shown per audit
- Lock/export features & API access to Pro/Premium only
- Block SEO suggestions for Free plan
- Add banners or UI hints if users hit their limit
- Show current plan and usage on dashboard

---

✅ 7. **Test All Features**
- Make sure I can:
  - Sign up as a Free user and get 3 working audits
  - Upgrade to Pro or Premium via Stripe
  - Actually see more keywords and suggestions per higher plan
  - Use export and API only when subscribed

---

📝 Bonus (Optional):

- Add logout button in header
- Make it mobile responsive
