# SaaS Redesign & Feature Implementation Instructions

## 1. Landing Page & Navigation
- Build a landing page with navigation links: Home, Plans, FAQ, About, Create Account / Login.
- Home page should introduce the tool and have a strong call-to-action: “Try the tool for free — create an account now.”
- Plans page lists pricing and features for each plan.
- FAQ page answers common questions.
- About page describes the company/product.
- “Create Account” and “Login” buttons should be clearly visible.

## 2. User Authentication (Supabase)
- Integrate Supabase Auth for email/password signup and login.
- After login, redirect users to a Dashboard page.
- Store user info, subscription plan, and usage stats (audits done, keywords generated, links checked) in Supabase database.

## 3. Subscription Plans & Usage Limits
Implement these plans:

| Plan     | Audits/month | SEO Suggestions per audit | Keywords per link | Links per month | Price      |
|----------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Free     | 1            | N/A                      | 5                 | 3               | $0         |
| Pro      | 3            | 5                        | 10                | Unlimited       | $15/month  |
| Premium  | 5            | 10                       | 15                | Unlimited       | $30/month  |

- Enforce these limits on the backend.
- For Free users, limit usage accordingly and show usage stats on Dashboard.
- For Pro and Premium, allow unlimited links but limit audits, suggestions, and keywords per link.

## 4. Stripe Integration
- Connect Stripe for subscription management.
- Allow users to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel plans from the Dashboard.
- Use Stripe webhooks to update user subscription status and plan in Supabase.
- Show billing and payment history if possible.

## 5. Tool Access & Usage Enforcement
- Require login to access the keyword & audit tool.
- Before processing a request, check user limits and usage.
- If limits are reached, block further requests and display an upgrade prompt.
- Show remaining quota (audits left, keywords left, links left) in the Dashboard and tool page.

## 6. UI/UX & Design
- Design the app as a professional SaaS with:
  - Clean, responsive layout.
  - Consistent colors and fonts.
  - Clear navigation and buttons.
  - Dashboard with usage statistics and upgrade options.

Please start with the landing page and auth integration first, then implement subscription plans and limits. Let me know if you need example code snippets or design mockups.
